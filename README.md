## File description
We have 2 folders, Code for the whole model we proposed in the paper, Data for sample data from the original full dataset.

Do note that the sample data is only a very small proportion of the full dataset (2 batch for each split). These are provided to show our code is executable. For interested readers, please refer to the paper's citations. All datasets we used are publically available. One should be able to download and preprocess these data.

For any further questions, please contact gmou@wpi.edu and I would be more than happy to reply.
